  <h3>Outside Cryochamber</h3>

<div class="room introduction">
  <p>As you quietly walk out of the Cryochamber, you begin to smell something rotten. You scan the area, and you immediately spot a person who is wearing the same outfit as you. You identify this person to be non-hostile. With a soft yell, you successfully get its attention. The person turns around slowly and growls like an angry dog. You notice that something is not right about this person as soon as you hear it growl. It spots you, and angrily charges towards you.</p>
  <p>You look for a way out, but it's approaching fast. You keep you composure. You have no choice but to fight. </p>
