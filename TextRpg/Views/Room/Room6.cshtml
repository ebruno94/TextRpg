  <h3>Medical Bay</h3>
</div>

<div class="event introduction">
  <p>You slowly enter Medical Bay and the stench of death overwhelms you. Blood smeared all over the room, and you notice the bodies on the operating tables.
  You check the first body and notice that the body is still warm. You check for vitals... nothing. As you move on checking the bodies, you hear a cry. "Please.... it hurts..."
  You run towards the cry and you notice that its your friend Mackey. You guys have been friends ever since you were kids and was always there to protect you. Mackey cried as blood sputtered out of his mouth "Please "Character"... you have to help me." You looked look closer and took off the blanket covering his body and noticed that his other half is gone.
  You grab his bloody hand as he shivers from pain. Tears come flowing out of you as you say "It's going to be okay Mackey, it's going to be okay." You look around the room and notice a Doctor's Desk and Medicine Cabinet.</p>

<div class="event initHidden" id="event2">
  <p>Trembling, You tell Mackey "This is going to make you feel better." As He shivers from pain, you insert the syringe of morphine in his arm.
     You see his body relax instantaneously and he calmly whispers "stay with me okay?..." You tell him "I'll be right here." You grab his hand as his breath starts to slow down. As he takes his last breath, tears fall from your face and you whisper "I will miss you my friend..." <p>
