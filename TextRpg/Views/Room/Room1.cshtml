<div class="introduction">
  <p>You open your eyes to see the glass in front of you slowly receding. A sudden wave of warm air overwhelms your entire body as you rack your mind to remember where you are. Your name's @Game.GetGameUser().GetCharacter().GetName(), and it's the year 2025. You've been sent with approximately 500 others on humanity's first attempt to colonize Mars. Beyond the confines of your own cryochamber, you see a large open expanse surrounded with approximately 100 other chambers. The room is fairly dark. If it weren't for the softly-glowing red light in the middle of the ceiling, you wouldn't be able to see anything.

  You take in a deep breath, expecting the clean, slightly chemical smell all-too-familiar to anyone who's ever spent much time on a space vessel--or in a hospital. Instead, you notice something stronger. It reminds you of the last day you spent on Earth before embarking on this journey, nearly six months ago. Your family and friends surprised you with a barbecue. You can smell the smoldering coals from the grill ... or is that the smell of the bonfire you sat around with your significant other that evening planning all the things you would do together after you return? What you would give for a swig of that whiskey you two shared that night ...

  Urged forward by the warmth of the outside air and the smell of home, you slowly peel off the sensors adhered to your chest  and step out of the chamber.

  Around the room you see cryochambers, a computer terminal, an equipment locker, and--at the far-side of the room--two doors which presumably lead out of it.</p>
